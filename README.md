## Overview

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200721175643/databaseanswers.org">Database Answers <em>(archive.org)</em></a> served as an outstanding resource during my exploration of data design, and it disheartened me to learn of its discontinuation.

My intention behind this revival is to carry on its legacy and help both myself and others who may benefit from it.

Database Answers was a website that had a dedicated focus on offering resources and guidance related to database design and management.

The website offered solutions to prevalent challenges regarding databases, intending to aid individuals and businesses in developing efficient and well-organized database systems.

It featured articles, tutorials, and tools to support users in improving their approach to database design and implementation.
