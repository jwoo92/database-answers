This Page defines a General Approach to the design of an integrated Data Model from a number of different 'Data Islands'
or Applications.</b>

<P>This Approach is based on a sequence of Steps in a structured method to <b>establish the FACTS</b> :-

<br><font size=2>
<OL>
<li>Review of individual Data Models and establishing any overlap,
<li>dentify any inconsistencies and areas where data mapping needs to be defined.
<li>Define the Area of Interest,(e.g. CRM).
<li>Define the "Things of Interest",(e.g. Customers), in the Area of Interest.
<li>Analyze the Things of Interest and identify the corresponding Tables.
<li>Establish the relationships between the Tables.
<li>Determine the characteristics of each Table,(e.g. a Customer has a Date-of-Birth).
<li>Obtain a small set of Sample Data,
<br>e.g. "John Doe is a Maintenance Engineer and was born on 1st. August, 1965 and
lives at 22 Woodland Street, New Haven.
<li>Confirm the first draft of the Database design against the Sample Data.
<li>Obtain from the users some representative enquiries for the Database,
<br>e.g. "How many Calls did John Doe make last month ?"
<li>Review the Results of Steps 1) to 7) with appropriate people, such as Users, Managers,
<br>Development staff, etc. and repeat until the final Data Model design is reached.
