We have not been able to find a definition of Data Architecture that is good enough.
<br>Therefore, we have produced our own definition, which we have based on the
<br>definition of an Architecture for a house which defines a number of <b>Rooms</b> :-
<li>Each Room has a defined purpose.
<li>All the Rooms combine together to serve some overall useful purpose.
<li>Each Room has a clearly-defined interface with adjacent Rooms.
<li>Each Room has at least one point of Entry and Exit.

<br><br>We have developed a General Approach to the design of Data Architectures, based on the
<br>identification of 'Data Islands' linked by Bridges which have specified Interfaces to control
<br>Data Transfer over the Bridges.
<P>We have successfully applied our Approach to :-
<OL>
<li><a href="crm/general_approach.html">a CRM Data Architecture.</a>
<li><a HREeeF="bus_intelligence/general_approach.html">a Business Intelligence Data Architecture.</a>
<li><a HREeeF="ecommerce/general_approach.html">an e-Commerce Data Architecture.</a>
</OL>

<P>It is intended that this Approach should be adopted and enhanced on the basis of experience,
<br>so that it defines the 'Standards of Best Practice' for this activity.

<P>A separate Page discusses <a href="need_for_data_arch.html"><b>why we need a Data Architecture.</b></a>


<P>The Approach is defined as a series of Steps,with associated Background comments,
<br>some clearly-defined <a href="deliverables.html">Deliverables</a>,and some sample Template Forms which can be used
<br>in the application of the Approach to a specific Project.

<P>The General Approach is based on designing the Architecture at
<a HREeeF="sample_docs/three_levels.doc">three Levels of Specification :-
<li>The Logical Level
<li>The Physical Level
<li>The Implementation Level


<!---
<P>The Data Architecture is designed in one of three Stages  :-
<P><li><b>Stage 1 : Create the Logical Design.</b>
<P><li><b>Stage 2 : Create the Physical Design.</b>
<P><li><b>Stage 3 : Create the Implementation Design for a Pilot Project</b>
