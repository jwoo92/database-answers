   <b><li>Your site is exactly what I needed</b> --
   tells what a dba is, what skills are needed, what kinds of jobs you
   can get using db development/management skills, everything.

   If you had sat down and designed a site custom-tailored

   I combed the Web looking for information I needed ...
   ... then I found your site. EVERYTHING is there, exactly as I
   need and want it.

   Keep it up!
