<a href="index.html">Back to the Physical Data Model</a>.
<br><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>Design for a database for a Pub Quiz League :-
<br>The Application is a Quiz league for the village pubs.
<P>The Database will store about 10,000 questions.
The Questions are split into Categores, (in a Table called 'Ref Categories' for Reference Data).
<br>Typical Categories would be Sports, Music, Travels, and so on.
<P>
At weekly intervals, or as required, the System will choose 50 questions at random from
the database for each pub in the league.
<P>Then, the following week another 50 questions randomly for each pub but
not duplicating previous questions.

<br>Each pub would be receiving a completely different set of questions every week and the
Application will keep a record of the questions issued to each Pub.

Hi Steve,
Here's a very useful link :-
http://www.allaboutpubs.com/trivia.html

which has a Page with a Quiz you can take :-
http://www.allaboutpubs.com/PubQuiz.html
This Page displays a Quiz that you can print, and you register each time, so I am sure it would ensure that you didn't get the same question twice.

I guess you'd prefer to find a system to administer the Quiz rather than do it yourself ?
In which case, this should fit the bill.

Please let me know how you get on.

Dear Barry,

Many thanks for replying so promptly.

Although this looks like quite a good quiz site I don't really think it would suit our requirements. There appears to be only 20 questions for which there are multi-choice answers - I don't think that this system would be very popular. Also, a new quiz is posted only monthly. We would probably be looking to do our quizzes weekly over the winter months.

We may be able to do the quiz ourselves if you can suggest which direction to go in relation to databases. I think we would prefer to do it this way but if there are no suitable databases for the system we require then 'allabout pubs' may be an option.

Thanks once again and I look forward to your reply.
