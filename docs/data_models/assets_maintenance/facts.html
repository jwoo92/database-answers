<hr><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>User Requirements :-
<b>An Assets Maintenance database.</b>

<b>Functional Requirements.</b>
Authorized Users (Five sales people) should have access to the database to enter a
new complaint or to edit already opened complaint.

Those five sales persons can login each time to the diferent computer ( 3 computers).

Because I should track who opened complaint ( or edited already opened), there is a login problem.

Each sales person should write to the system ( probably into customers details column),
details about complaint. When another sales person some other day open the already opened complaint to
add some aditonal information, new date should be entered and it should be recognized who added
aditional info about complaint...,

when the complaint is resolved, some kind of new box is shown on the form, in which person
can put amount of money we pay back to the customer to resolve a complaint.

In summary:

The System should track who, when (date, time) has anything to do with new complain or has
edited already opened, and what information was put into system.

<br>Design Notes :-

<!---
<br>I have shown the 'Third_Party_Companies' Entity as being either a Supplier or a Maintenance Contractor.
<br>This makes the Database more readable and easier to use, at the expense of generality.
<br>In practice, a Supplier is also likely to provide Maintenance, and therefore be both a Supplier and
a Maintenance Contractor.
<br>However, for an alternative design with more generality I have defined an Entity called 'Ref_Company_Types'.
<br>I have not used it and so it is not joined in a Relationship to any other Entity.
<br>If this Reference Data Entity were to be used it would be necessary, of course, to add a 'company_type_code' to the 'Third_Party_Companies'
Entity, and then you could either remove or leave the maintenance_contractor_yn and supplier_yn attributes.
