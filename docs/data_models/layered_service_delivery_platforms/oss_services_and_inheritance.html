This is the the Service Inheritance Data Model for our DBA Cloud Services.
<br>Of course, we have to use the word 'Service' with two different meanings,
<br>even though it is a litle confusing until you get used to it.

<pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>6. Demonstration Data</b>

All of this data will be loaded using Apex before development  begins.
