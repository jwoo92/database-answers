<td align=left valign=top><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>Slide 1 - The Problem</b>
<br><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>Hello and Welcome.
My name is Barry Williams and I am the Founder and
Principal Consultant with Database Answers.

<b>The Problem</b>
The Internet of Things is attracting a lot of interest from
a wide range of organisations.

This is generating many diverse approaches to IoT and creating
the problem of integrating these approaches.

<td align=left valign=top><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>Slide 2 - The Solution</b>

I have a unique solution to this problem, which
is a Universal IoT Platform.

This Platform will be built on our Layered Data
Architecture which is shown in this diagram.

<td align=left valign=top><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>Slide 3 - Development Plan</b>

My Development plan is to build Platforms for
Industry-specific Applications  as shown here and
then integrate them into the overall IoT Platform.

<td align=left valign=top><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>Slide 4 - Marketing</b>
<br>Our Platform is being built with Oracleï¿½s
Cloud-based Data-as-a-Service and our current
thinking about marketing is to work with Oracle
and Oracle Partners.

Oracle is very keen to be dominant in the Clouds
and their Partners will include those with a special
interest in IoT who have a knowledge of the marketplace.

in the Forensics book, Anthropology is called <b>"The Science of&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Bones"</b>
<br><br>In other words, the Evidence is predominantly Bones, the
<br>Analysis involves tests and techniques that are appropriate
<br>to Bones and the Analysis is the identification of an individual
<br>human being from the evidence of Bones.
<br><br>
A number of <b>Participants</b> play different <b>Roles</b> including
<br>anthropologists, X-ray technicians and photographers.
<br>Work took place at a  number of <b>Locations</b>, including murder
<br>sites, laboratories and courts.

<br>A variety of <b>Documents</b> is involved, such as Reports of
<br>Findings, Court Proceedings and Publications.
<br><br>A wide range of activities is involved, which we can classify as
<br><b>Events</b>.
