<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>2. Rule 2. Decide how these 'Things' related
We decide that 'Clubs employ Players and Players play Games against other Clubs.
Then we might decide to include the very valuable aspect of what are called Master-Detail Relationshisps
<br>To do this we need to use a Logical Model that we call an 'Entity-Relationalship Diagram' which we show on the right here

<td align=left valign=top><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>3. Decide how they are related (continued)
So far so good - except that when we think about how this works in practice, we realise
that not all Players play in every Game.
Therefore we have to add a Teams 'Thing of Interest' to cope with this requirement.
A Player will usually play in the same position.
But changes are possible and to provide for these chamges, our design must provide for
Teams to be drawn up for each Game.

So our Business Rules become :-
Clubs employ Players who play in Teams in Games against other Clubs.
The specific Players in each Team are decided in time for the Game.</pre>

How do we identify things ?
<br><img src="images/id_med.jpg">

<br>


We can identify things that are small in number by a Name or Code.
This applies to the School and Classrooms and perhaps Teachers.
For other things, like Classes or Students, we usually generate numbers, such as ABC123.
Then, of course, we keep a table to translate each number to a specific name.

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>Data Marts with Conformed Dimensions
This is an alternative to the Dimensional Model shown above.
In this approach we sewpatate the data in the Dimensional into Games and Playeers and each has its own Data Mart.
THen we identify the Dimensions that they share and show them between the two Data Marts.
We cal these 'Conformed Dimensions' because the values have to conform to the same values in each Data Mart.
If they do not, then the values cannot be used to join Data Sets and the results obtained would be complete nonsense.
Putting it differently, if the shared dimensions are not Conformed then our work as Data Warehouse designers and
BI specialists would be completely wasted and we should take up a different line of work.
The best and simplest example of a Conformed Dimension is dates, which we show in a Calendar.
In passing, I call my Calendar entity 'Ref_Calendar' to emphasise the fact that it is Reference Data.

Dates in a calendar are an example of Master Data, and by definition, Master Data will always be Conformed Dimensions
because they represent one consistent value across an organisation.

In our case, w can use the Games Data Mart to obtain statistics about the Club and its standing in the League.

The Players Data Mart, of course, would be used to obtain individual statistics about our favourite players and to
identify, for example, who is the most prolific scorer.</pre>
