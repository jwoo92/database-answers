<br><br><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_new">Wikipedia</a> says that a
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_asset" target="_new">
"A financial asset</a> is an intangible asset that derives value because of a contractual claim.
 <br>Examples include bank deposits, bonds, and stocks.
 <br>Financial assets are usually more liquid than tangible assets, such as land or real estate, and
 are traded on financial markets.
 <br>According to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a financial asset is defined as one of the following:
 <li>Cash or cash equivalent;
 <li>Equity instruments of another entity;
 <li>Contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial
 <br>liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity;
 <li>Contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments and is either a non-derivative for which the
 <br>entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments, or a derivative that will
 <br>or may be settled other than by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the
 <br>entity's own equity instruments
