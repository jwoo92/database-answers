"Hi Barry

I'd value your opinion on a database model I am considering creating in MS Access.
It will be a database of a particular aircraft type from WW2.
I have all the data on paper and want to include

Each aircrafts registration number

It's place of manufacture, whether it was Mark I II III etc.
Engine type

The squadron/training units it was assigned to in it's history.

I looked at the Database in the subject and wondered if you
consider this to be a good starting point, or have a better example?

Kind Regards
Neil"</pre>
