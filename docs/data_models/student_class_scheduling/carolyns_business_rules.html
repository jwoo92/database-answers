This page lists the Businss Rules that define the logic behind the Data Model.
They are produced by Carolyn and accepted by Barry so that they become a jointly agreed document that combines
the Requirements (produced by Carolyn) and the Design (produced by Barry) that meets the Requirements.

<hr>This is the text of Carolyn's Email, of March 23rd. 2013 :-
You are awesome!!  Luv u man!!
<li>Students can attend many classes
<li>They must attend all four sessions
<li>Sometimes we have to schedule a make-up class
<li>Once students go through the 4 week class (specifically � Preparing to Teach) � they can actually become a teacher/instructor
<li>I thought I had found a database template that does the job for this, but of course it does not.
<li>The reports wouldn�t let me show how many peeps attended what class, but they did allow me to use that fabulous list with the
    A � B � C phone directory.
    Love it!
    (IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDENT DATABASE TEMPLATE BY MICROSOFT ACCESS)
    Love the forms in that database.

<li>The instructors need to take classes to keep up and ensure they are teaching facts and not opinion.
<li>At month end � I need to submit a report to show who attended what classes and who graduated from student to instructor.
<li>Each month my pastor recommends a �Book of the month�.
    We want to offer that book to the first person to sign up for the new classes.
    I will need to give a report at qtr and year end for what books were given away,
    who got them and add a new list of books for the New Year.
<li>So we track our teachers, classes, students, and winners.
<li>One added feature � I watched DATAPIG and he shares how to set up the phone list which simply looks so cool.</pre>
