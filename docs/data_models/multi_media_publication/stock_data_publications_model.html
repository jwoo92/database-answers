<b>A   DATA   MODEL   FOR   STOCK   DATA PUBLICATIONS</b>

<br><br>The Business Rules have been drafted for Brian's review as follows :-
<li>StockData is received on a Daily basis, and is stored in a Database Table called StockData_dd8daily.

<li>Different selections of the StockData are published as Products that Customers can subscribe to.
<li>These selections are called Views, and each View has a unique View_ID to identify it.
<li>Customers subscribe to these Views and pay Subscriptions.
<li>Details of which Customers subscribe to which Views will be stored in the Customers_Subscriptions Table.
