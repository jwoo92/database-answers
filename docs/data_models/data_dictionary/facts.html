<a href="index.html">Back to the Conceptual Data Model</a>
<pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>Here is a sample of a range of User Requirements ...
<OL><li><b>From John Doe :-</b>
I'd like a data dictionary to be a common-ground repository of business and technical knowledge.
What I would like is seldom on offer...... but I keep trying.

Imagine a resource that links to describe business terminology as well as loading history,
as well as "process impact" (where the item is created and used ).

Lengths, formats, informats, labels, indexing, sorting integrity constraints and
business constraints should co-exist with some description of the data item's owner,
maintainer and significance to the business.

The surface for this might need some hardworking-html or xml.
But I think the payback could be very high.

Such a resource on an intranet could provide a backbone of documentation that both
business analysts and infrequent query writers could find answers that satisfy what they need
without trying to imagine appropriate keywords for a limited indexed online help.

Just how far documentation is becoming important seems to be crystalized by some of the
"proof of validated code must be retained for n years" issues.

In the banking world a "new" set of <b>"Basel II"</b> rules are making some serious change impact.

I think this is more than just "a good idea".
As data warehouses and datamarts become more complex and versions overlap, only clear,
quickly accessible description will provide any chance of "keeping up".
(I shouldn't forget that it has to be maintained !)

All that is going to need more than "dictionary tables" !

It probably needs documentation warehouses.
..add
...version control to prepare for future change.
... audit history to explain accounting data over the last n years
...
Despite all that sophistication, I also need simple ways to populate a list of date variables or
currency values, or rates , or percentage values...... each needing its own formatting rules.
URL access is available, but well structured xml might be better for simple data access to this
Data Dictionary.

I don't expect it to reside on my desktop or lan, but replicates of my subset of interest might. The
important thing is that any changes to this magic dictionary must be centralised to ensure we all have
the same "big-picture" available.

<b>Is it just a pipe-dream ?</b>

Yours in hope.

John.


<li><b>From Joe Bloggs</b>

I, too, will be interested in looking at other's responses to your question.

The answer, I think, will have to correspond to how it is going to be used.

When I hear the term "data dictionary" I expect to find the various variable names,
their formats (and informats), how data may have been recoded, the different values that
can appear for categorical variables and what those values mean, whether the values for a
particular variable serve as an index for other files (and, of course, how they have to be sorted),
where each data element comes from, and the designed purpose of each data element.

Some of the above can be included in a SAS format statement, the form in which I (personally) like to
see data dictionaries, so that others can analyze a dataset without having to search for the meaning of
it's contents.

<li><b>From Fabienne PASCALE</b>
The data dictionary is an absolutely essential document.
It follows from the data collection form from which one can deduce what exactly the
questionners were trying to prompt the questionnees to respond.

Here is my outline for a data dictionary:

<b>* Description of Project:</b>
  date, time,
  people: interested parties,
          who to contact when meltdown occurs
  contract

<I>* Abbreviations</I>

<I>* Editing Instructions:</I>
  how to wedge what was written on the form
  into the confines of the variable definitions
  * "place a zero in front of a decimal number
     i.e. change '.618' to '0.618'"

<I>* Formats</I>
  which are written so they can be cut&pasted
  into aFormat.sas,
  the one and only program which contains formats
  remember to define initialization values
  and EverythingElse:
value $YesNo
      '0' = 'No'
      '1' = 'Yes'
     ' ','.'= "&BLANK." %*initialize;
     other  = "&INVALID.";%*EverythingElse;

<I>* Data Set:</I>
  * variables that are identifiers
  * notes on data structure
  * variable descriptions:
  * note on length of numeric variables:
    *integer length=4, or 3, or 2
             this is system dependent
    *real    length=8
    *be not confused by people saying
     that you need more than 8 bytes
     for numbers greater than 99,999,999

          Type:
Variable  Length  Format     Label
--------  ------  ------     ------------
IDNum      N:4    5.         ID-1 Number
BatchNo    C:8    $char8.    Batch Number

** see Stevens's Measurement System, below .sig

<I>* Date Sets</I>
  Naming conventions
  Names of deliverables

Bon chance et Bon Courage

<li><b>From Hobo DBA</b>
The dataset/study that brought up the need for a data dictionary is the same one I
posted questions about earlier on how to clean up really messy data.
In fact the client was supposed to provide a data dictionary to me but it was next to
worthless because it simply listed the fields in each <b>Microsoft Access</b> table along with
the data type and a lable which for the most part was simply a restatement of the variable name.

Most of thefields in the tables were free form fields.
As a result the data dictionary they provided was even more useless.

All of the data is from responses to medical questionnaires with quite a few yes/no responses.
So I've had to ask what does -1 mean and 0 mean or in some cases what does 1 or 2 or 3 mean
(even with the questionnaire in had you can't really tell the value they will decide to represent
'yes' or 'no' in the database).


<li><b>From Greg, a Clinical Trials Data Manager</b>

Hi,
I work on a clinical trial, where we use more than 180 datasets, collected over nearly 20 years of research.
We have a system of data dictionaries.

This includes:
1.  The forms that were used for data collection, showing the library,
    dataset and variable name for each variable.
    Each form is assigned a unique identifier ('formcode') that shows not only which form,
    but the version of the form.
    Over the years we've changed some forms many times.
    This is a problem for normalization affecionados, since there are many
    null values and datasets contain fields that are not applicable for
    certain formcodes (i.e., we've stopped asking about bone fractures, though
    we had asked and retain the data from 5 years previous), though these
    records are still in the same table becasue of the formcode.
2.  Each variable from above is assigned a format using the same name as
    the variable, when possible.  When this is not possible, the format name
    is written into the form source.  All formats are contained in one
    document, so that all formats load (from sasv8.cfg, for example) at SAS boot.
    When possible (when the programmer remembers), the format is
    assigned in the datastep, as well as the label, so that the variable
    retains the format.
3.  A flow chart documents the database update process (its a three day process).
    This is quite useful for the summary tables that are used.
    Since these summary tables contain data not directly matched against a
    form, tracing the origin and source of the data can be difficult when I
    only have to modify somehting every few years.  Flowcharts help me and I
    consider them part of the data dictionary.
4.  Proc Contents is run to provide all the labels, lengths, etc.

5.  General rules related to the variables, such as standard formats and
    lengths for dates, how formcodes are assigned, how batchid (the key-entry/
    datascan batch source) etc are all pooled into one document.
6.  The key, or composite key, is identified for each dataset in a text file.
    Additionally each record in the text file (which is read in every database
    by the programs creating and managing the data) contains:
       DATASET   SORT1     SORT2     SORT3...     (we are set up to 15, but only
                 a few use up to 6, most sort on 2 vars.)
       COMPRESS  flag indicates whether or not dataset should normally be stored
                 with the SAS compress option set.
       DATABASE  Library identifier.  Tells the directory and whether or not
                 there are suffix digits after the dataset
       CREATOR   Name of update program that creates the file.
       REJECT    Process rejected records from the central database update:
       FORM1     Form number of primary association.  FORM2     Form number of
                 secondary association. etc.
       UPDT      Update by program or by copying previous VERP
       ORDER     Runing order of programs in BATCH1.CMD

7.  Last, I maintain a document of the reports, both routine (yearly,
    monthly, weekly) and ad-hoc.  These reports have numbers that identify
    them, and list the datasets that are used to generate the report.
    So when I modify a dataset I can quickly view what effect it will have on the
    reporting of the study.

FWIW

<li><b>From Quentin, Another Interested Party</b>

I think you need to start by thinking about what information you want to
have in the dictionary, what organization you want it to have, and what
format(s) you want (ASCII? PDF? html?).

These questions take a lot of thought, and it's nice to have them answered
before starting to code.  When I think data dictionary,
I think descriptive information on each variable (what could that mean? perhaps
frequencies, perhaps mean/sd/min/max, perhaps UNIVARIATE... ).
But I think in terms of a data dictionary that I would give to an analyst.
If I were making data dictonaries for programmers, I would want to include
information on the type of each variable, length, format, etc.

In any case, <I>a good Data Dictionary</I> is a great asset to a project/division/company.
It's worth spending time thinking about who the users of the data dictionary will be, and
what their needs are.

Once you have designed the layout and content for the dictionary, coding should flow from that.
I'd think in terms of FREQ, MEANS, and UNIVARIATE to get summary statistics for each variable.
And plenty of use of dictionary tables (esp dictionary.tables and dictionary.columns).
And then ODS gives you plenty of options is terms of file formats.

There are lots of fun challenges, for example, assuming you want to give FREQs on character variables,
what do you want to do when a character variable has 200 different levels?
What's a good way to summarize a SAS date variable (probably don't want to summarize BirthDate as
average number of days since 1/1/1960)?

If I were I to start working on a %MakeDictionary macro, I think I would approach
it as a structured-programming exercise.  There are lots of little tasks, and each one would get
it's own little macro (%FindVarType, %DescribeNumVar, %DescribeCharVar, %DescribeDateVar... )
[My thanks to Ed Heaton for introducing me to such organization.]
Without that, I'd fear the entire macro would get out-of-hand.

I hope this hasn't been so general as to be unhelpful.  I'll look forward to
seeing other people's thoughts, and perhaps references to existing macros???

Kind Regards,
--Quentin

<b>From Kisaburo Watanabe</b>
I've been dreaming of a system that's kind of like an old BBS, but with
a few minor differences.  Basically, I want a central place to easily
store and retrieve reams of files and data that I have spread out all
over the place.

Idea/Need: A server that one can log into (possibly via modem) that has
the following features:
 - Use requires nothing more than a terminal emulator
 - Multiuser capability
 - Allows user to upload/download files of arbitrary size up to 1 Gb each
 - Allows user to create "forms" with fields of the user's choosing,
   which can then used to create records..  The fields could contain text
   the the user enters, data copied from a field in another record, a link
   to another record, or a link to a file
 - Files, forms, and records are accessed via a hierarchical menu system
   that <I>the user can modify on-the-fly as needed</I>.

Now, before I spend god-knows-how-much time writing such a thing, does anybody know if
such a thing already exists?  What I've described sounds a lot like a CUI BBS, but is
missing certain features (like mail and chat) and includes things that a BBS wouldn't have
(add forms and records, ability to change the menus around as needed).
