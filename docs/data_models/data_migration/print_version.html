<b>Design Patterns in Data Migration</b>
<br>This page starts with the suggestion that Data Models are 'A Good Thing' and you can never have too much of 'A Good Thing'
<br>Therefore, if the answer to everything is a Data Model then what exactly are the Questions ?

<br>
<br>We propose that an End-to-End range of Data Models provides a robust and generalised foundation for any
Data Migration activity.
<br>Of course, we consider it is true that 'Data Migration' is a deceptively simple way of describing the activities
that occupy most of our waking (or working) hours most of the time.
<br>This is appropriate whether we are Data Architects, Data Modellers or Data Analysts,
where each role has a different range of skills and responbsibilities.

<br>We start with Operational Data Stores and end with a Dimensional Model that feeds data for a BI Layer.

<br><br>Our question then becomes :-
<br>What kind of Data Models do we need to cover our End-to-End Scope ?

<br><br>
We propose a range from ODS, Data Mapping, Data Warehouse, Dimensional Models and Semantic Models

<br><br>This seems a modest ambition, so let's discuss it in detail to see if it holds up under detailed analysis.

<table border=1><tr>
<td valign=top><align=CENTER><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>This page shows <b>four Design Patterns in Data Migration</b>.
<br><br><b>1) The first Design Pattern</b> shows Semantic Data Models which provide a 'User Friendly' front-end.
<br>This helps Users to request KPIs, Reports and analyses using words and terminology that they normally use.
<br>For example, talking about Customers, rather than Parties.

<br>If Semantic Data Models have been created, then we can say that the work has been done to the established standards of Best Practice.

<br><b>2) The second Design Pattern</b> shows Mapping Specifications which translate Source data to Target data.

<br><br><img alt="Mapping Specifications" HEIIIIGHT=633 valign=top src="images/2_data_mapping_specifications.gif">

<hr><b>3) The third Design Pattern</b> identifies KPIs, and traces their derivation.
<br>This helps to establish the Data Lineage for Sarbanes-Oxley and other Statutory Reporting requirements.

<b>4) The fourth Design Pattern</b> shows the complete End-to-End scope of Data Models.
<br>The <a href="../canonical_data_models/common_data_model.html">Common Data Model</a> is used to standardise data that is loaded into the Data Warehouse (DWH).
<br>We can also be sure that we have a 'Single View of the Truth' at any point in time.
<br>It helps us to build the design of the DWH in a step-by-step fashion.
<br><br>We identify that the Enterprise Data Warehouse is a top-level design which will have lower-level <b>Subject Area Models</b> such as Customer Purchases.

<br>Finally, we show the complete <b>Data Warehouse Bus Architecture</b>
