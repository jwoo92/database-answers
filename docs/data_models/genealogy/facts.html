<br><b>FACTS for the Data Model for a Genealogy Family Tree</b></font>

<P>
<pre><font color=blue face=Verdana size=2>The Approach :-
<b>Establish the Business Rules or FACTS</b>
<li>The Facts define what is known about the 'Things of Interest' in the area being studied.
<li>They establish an English-language version of the relationships between the 'Things of Interest'
which can be understood and agreed to by the key people such as Users.
This is very useful when the 'Things' become Entities or Tables in the Database.

The purpose of defining the Facts is to establish common understanding and agreement of the important
terms and concepts involved in Genealogy.
<hr>I added some additional Facts after discussions with Rory on December 14th. 2007.
<b>1. Families</b>
An individual can be in zero or one Family.
In other words, an Individual may or may not be part of a Family, but cannot be in more
than one Family at one time.

<b>2. Relationships</b>
Two Individuals can be in one and only one Relationship at any point in time.
In fact, my design allows for two people to be in more than one Relationship, but I can't think of
any examples right now !
This is regardless of whether they are members of a Family.
For example, a Parent will always have a Parent/Child Relationship with their Children, even if the
Parents get divorced.
<hr>
<b>A note on Families :-</b>
The Model has to allow for the concept of a family.
In other words, to define one family from another so that an individual can be a member of
more than one family, for example, step parents.

<b>A. The Things of Interest are :-</b>
A.1 Individuals
A.2 Relationships

<b>B. Business Rules :-</b>
B.1 Every INDIVIDUAL can be involved in zero or many RELATIONSHIPS.
B.2 Each INDIVIDUAL plays a ROLE in a RELATIONSHIP.
B.3 Every RELATIONSHIP involves two INDIVIDUALS.

<b>C. Valid Relationships are :-</b>
C.1 Families
C.2 Marriages

The Data Model supports an infinite number of RELATIONSHIPS,
which can be easily added to the RELATIONSHIPS Table as required.

<b>D. Valid Roles are :-</b>
C.1 Brother
C.2 Daughter
C.3 Father
C.4 Husband
C.5 Mother
C.6 Partner
C.7 Sister
C.8 Son
C.9 Wife

The Data Model supports an infinite number of ROLES,
which can be easily added to the ROLES Table as required.

I'm trying to create a genealogy or "family tree" database.

Here's how I currently have it set up (condensed the insignificant
parts a lot):

Person_ID, Parent_ID, Name, Etc,

Here's an example tree:

Grandpa--Dad--Son
            \-Daughter--child1
                       \child2
Here's the data:
1, 0, Origin of family tree, etc.
2, 1, Grandpa, etc.
3, 2, Dad, etc.
4, 3, Son, etc.
5, 3, Daughter, etc.
6, 5, child1, etc.
7, 5, child2, etc.

Basically everyone has an ID, and the Parent_ID field links the person
their.  So if the son has a child, the new child gets the next
available number as a Person_ID, and is linked to the son's ID (3)
with the Parent_ID field.

This all works fine and dandy and makes sense to me.  Now comes the
challenge (for me anyhow :-)

I would like to print a report showing the tree, and make it possible
to start the report at any generation.  What I started with was a form
for adding/editing the people.  Then made a button on the form that
would take the current record and print it's genealogy (report).  To
make the report, I tried making a query called "generation1" that
would search for all Person_ID's whose Parent_ID matched the current
record.  This worked fine.  If "Dad" was the current record, the query
found "son" and "daughter" and it would be added to the report.  I
liked that, so I went ahead and tried to make a query called
"generation2" which was *supposed* to search the family database for
all records whose Parent_ID matched the Person_ID in the Generation1
query.  It seems that I can't query a query, or I'm formatting
something wrong.

If I simply set my criteria to match a field in query "Generation1" it
asks me for a value (instead of getting it from the query).  If I add
[query]![Generation1] and set a relationship up between Person_ID and
try to run the query (same criteria) it gives me the error:
'FamilyData.Parent_ID=[Generation1]![Person_ID]' is not part of
aggregate function or grouping.

I'm not sure what the error implies. I've tried several other things
to no avail.

Anyone have a solution?  I haven't been able to find any sort of
public domain template for setting up a genealogy database.  If you've
seen one, please point the way so I might integrate it.  Hey!  Maybe
I'm making something too complex here??

I appreciate any help!  Email or Post.

Thanks,

Michael.

I hate following up my own message.  Ugh.
Anyhow, I'm using Access7 if that makes a difference.

Since I posted, I also found a "Pedigree" example (thanks to
abrowne@odyssey.apana.org.au (webpage)) that uses self-joins.  It has
the possibility of working, but in his example, the third generation
has eight copies of the table.  I'm looking at ten generations in my
"family tree" so it will require 1024 copies on the tenth generation.
It seems that this is going to be a bit messy going this route :-)

Thanks again!

Michael.

Well, I'm doing it again.  Maybe I should just type a post, not send
it, and the answer will come to me.  Seems to be happening this way.

I have now set up a method that works pretty well, but it's awfully
slow to get a report.  I set up a query that has 5 copies (for 5
generations in this exapmle) and link the Person_ID to the Parent_ID
from one table to the next.  When I run the query, I get the following
output (commas added as a seperator only, not actualy in output :-)

Grandpa, Dad, Son, <blank>
Grandpa, Dad, Daughter, Child1
Grandpa, Dad, Daughter, Child2
Grandpa, Uncle, Son
Grandpa, Uncle, UDaughter

Then I made a query called Gen1 which Basically selects the unique
records from each generation, thus stripping out the duplicates. When
I run Gen1, I get the following output:

Grandpa

I did the same for the four other generations, so I get:

Gen2: Dad, Uncle
Gen3: Daughter, Son, UDaughter
Gen4: Child1, Child2

Then I made each of the five queries into a report.  I made my main
report with each of the five query reports as subreports.  So I
finally get a report like:

Generation 1:  Parent
Grandpa        Unknown

Generation 2:  Parent
Dad            Grandpa
Uncle          Grandpa

Generation 3:  Parent
Son            Dad
Daughter       Dad
UDaughter      Uncle

Generation 4:  Parent
Child1         Daughter
Child2         Daughter

Why am I telling you all this??  I guess so that someone might learn
from it themselves or possibly spot an area where I can speed up the
process and get the same result :-)

Thanks for any tips!

Michael.

Michael,

Interestingly enough, about two months ago I offered a solution to a local
research and development outfit who needed to do this with performing a
geneology on grass hybrids so they could track traits back to origin.

My memory is a bit rusty, so if you need me to reproduce an exact detail of
the solution it will take me a day or two... but in short, the solution is
to not use criteria but use multiple copies of the same table in the query
and then link each copy to the one before it... each copy represents a link
to a child from one of its immediate parents. So a 'grandchild' would need a
link to its mother and father, and then the father would need a link to his
mother and father... and you would generate different queries to come up
with different geneology depths.

As I mentioned, this is very general, but I'm sure that it would resolve the
data you would need to build your final tree. If you want me to fill in more
detail or attach a demo or anything... drop me an e-mail and give me a few
days.

Probably ought to just keep my mouth shut on this as I can appreciate the
challenge you're taking on setting this up in Access.  But is there some
reason it needs to be in Access when there are so many other genealogy
programs out there.  I considered it several years ago, but instead got
Family Tree Maker and it does a wonderful job of doing this simple task
plus so much more, especially the current version which came out a few
months ago.
