<br>Our Approach includes the following Steps :-
<br><li><b>Step 1.</b> Establish a thin slice from top to bottom for a Proof-of-Concept.
<!--- <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes from Data Governance at the top, down through BI and finishes by identifying the Data Sources. --->

<br><br><li><b>Step 2.</b> Choose a few Key Performance Indicators, ('KPIs')
<br>For example, sales as a percentage of population.

<br><br><li><b>Step 3.</b> Design the Data Marts for the KPIs
<br>These are based on a Generic Design with Dimensions and Facts.

<br><br><li><b>Step 4.</b> Identify the Data Sources required to provide the data for the KPIs.

<br><br><li><b>Step 5.</b> Define details of the Data Integration.
<br>This will include Data Quality and a Common Data Model with Master Data Management.
