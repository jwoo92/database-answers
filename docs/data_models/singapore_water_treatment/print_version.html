<b>Business Rules</b>

<br><br>We have drafted these Business Rules and created the Data Model accordingly.
<br>Then we discuss these Rules with business users and modify the Data Model accordingly.
<br>1. Customers (who can be Departments) ask for Jobs to be done.
<br>2. Equipment is involved in each Job.
<br>3. Staff, such as Engineers, are also involved in each Job.
<br>4. Documentation, such as Receipts and Work Orders, is used with each Job.
<br>5. Payments are made for each Job. These can be transfers of money between Departments.
