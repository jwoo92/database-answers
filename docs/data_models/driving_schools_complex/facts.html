Driving Schools (Complex)

Subject: driving school
Question:
1 Background LDC <b>driving school</b> was established over 20 years ago and is now one of the
largest and most successful national driving schools in the UK today.

However, the school is now so large that more and more administrative <b>staffs</b> are being
employed to cope with the ever-increasing amount of paperwork.

Furthermore, the communication and sharing of information between <b>offices</b>, even in the same <b>city</b>, is poor.
The director of the school, John Williams, feels that too many mistakes are being made
and the success of the school will be short-lived if he does not do something to remedy the situation.

He knows that a database could help in part to solve the problem and has approached you to help in
creating a database system to support the running of LDC driving school.

The Director has provided the following brief description of how the LDC driving school operates.

2.1 Data requirements
    Each office has a manager (who tends to also be a senior instructor), several senior instructors,
    instructors, and administrative staffs.

    The manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of the office.
    <b>Clients</b> must first register at an office, which includes completion of an <b>application form</b>, which records their personal details.
    Before the first <b>lesson</b>, a client is requested to attend an interview with an instructor to assess the
    needs of the client and to ensure that the client holds a valid provisional driving license.
    A client is free to ask for a particular <b>instructor</b> or to request that an instructor be changed at any stage
    throughout the process of learning to drive.
    After the interview, the first lesson is booked.
    A client may request individual lessons or book at a block of lessons for a reduced fee.
    An individual lesson is for one hour, which begins and ends at the office.
    A lesson is with a particular instructor in a particular <b>car</b> at a given time.
    Lessons can start as early as 08:00am, and as late as 08:00pm.
    After each lesson, the instructor records the progress made by the client and notes the mileage used during the lesson.

    The school has a pool of cars, which are adapted for the purposes of teaching.

    Each instructor is allocated to a particular car.
    As well as teaching, the instructors are free to use the cars for personal use.
    The cars are <b>inspected</b> at regular intervals for faults.
    Once ready, a client applies for a <b>driving test</b>< date.
    To obtain a full driving license, the client must pass both the driving and written parts of the test.
    It is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure that the client is best prepared for all aspects of the test.

    The instructor is not responsible for testing the client and is not in the car during the test, but should be
    available to drop off and pick up the client before and after the test at the testing centre.
    If the <b>client</b> fails the test, the <b>instructor</b> must record the reasons for the failure </pre>
