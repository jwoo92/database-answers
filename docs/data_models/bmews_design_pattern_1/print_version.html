<br><br>
This Model dates from 2001 and shows how Inheritance helps us to model both <a href="../customers_commercial_and_personal/index.html">Commercial and Personal Customers</a>.
<br><br>However it doesn't show any details of other things that we are interested in, like Payment Methods.
<br><br>So we look for another Model which is a more suitable starting-point for a Customer who is going to make a Purchase.

<td valign=top><font COLOr=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>Step 2 : Customers and Addresses</b>
<br><br>This Model dates from 2006 and shows a general solution for Customers and Addresses.

<br>We will have to add more Customer-related items to the Customer Entity but it is fine for a starting-point.

<td valign=top><font COLOr=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>Step 3 :A Customer makes a Payment</b>
<br><br>
This Model dates from 2010 and was part of a Master Data Management (MDM) approach.
<br>It includes Payment Methods and the MDM approach is good for this current work so we decide to includ it in our Top-Level Model.
<br><br>So we choose this <a href="../customers_and_payments_e_govt/customers_and_payments_subject_area.html">Customers and Payments</a> Model
and will adapt it to suit our requirements.

<br><br>This <a href="../retail_customers/customers_and_orders_model.html">Customers and Orders Model</a> dates from 2010.


<br><br>It includes (Customer-related) Mailshots and (Promotion-related) Promotions.
It is comprehensive so we decide to include it.

<br>You can choose the one which is more appropriate to your situation.
