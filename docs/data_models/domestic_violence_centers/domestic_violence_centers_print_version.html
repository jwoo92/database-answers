<br><br>

<font color=blue face=Verdana size=2><b>The User Requirements can be summarised as follows :-</b>
(1) A Clients' case management database for a domestic violence center.
(2) The database needs to track demographic information, referrals for clients, services provided for each Client.
    The range of Services includes Outreach, Shelter, Transitional Living & Hotline.

(3) Basic Personal Details are gathered for each Client, including Name, Age, Race, Income Levels.
    In addition, each Service (Outreach, Shelter, etc.) gathers different information.

(4)Therefore the 'Things Of Interest' include :-
   Cases, Clients, Referrals and Services.
   A Client can be recorded as many Cases over a period of time.

<b>This is the original Statement of User Requirements :-</b>
I represent an non-profit agency in FL called The Haven of RCS.

We are a domestic violence center and are being obligated by funders to develop a stand alone database for
clients' case management and for reporting purposes.
We need a clients case management Database.

We need to track demographic info, referrals for clients, services provided and some other more specific
information based on the clients location of service i.e., Outreach, Shelter, Transitional Living and hotline calls.

Hi Barry,Wow!! Thank you!
Since you are in England (sorry about my American presumptiveness).
I'll have to assume the tax letter wouldn't be very beneficial but please accept our sincere appreciation.

Is there anything I can provide you to help in the process such as what kind of information we collect or
anything else you may need.
Since each area (Outreach, Shelter, Transitional Living & Hotline) collects some of the same, and some
different information, an approach may be to enter basic name, age, race, income levels, etc in the opening
screens and then a button/link that would then collect other info related to each area.

Is this even possible? Also, how much tweaking can I do?
As I said, I'm not too familiar with Access but I do know most of the details of what we need to collect and
to include all of them would obviously be very time consuming for you.

Would one of your databases work as a starting point for this purpose or would you be willing to work with us for a short
period to get us going?

Of course, like all non-profits, we have no money but could provide a letter of your contribution for tax purposes.
I have minimal experience with Access but could work to learn enough to tweak something to our specific needs.

Thank you for your time,
