<br>These Businuess Rules define the guidelines for the Business Model.
<br>
<OL>
<li>A Customer can generate zero, one or many Requests for Products or Services.
<li>Many Suppliers can respond to each Request.
<li>Other organisations can respond to a Request, such delivery companies.
<br>&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;We refer to these as 'Parties' and each Party can play one Role in the
<br>&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;Procurement process.
<li>Other organisations can respond to a Request, such delivery companies.
<li>We can define a number of Events in the Procurement Process, such as Deliveries
<br>or Payments.
