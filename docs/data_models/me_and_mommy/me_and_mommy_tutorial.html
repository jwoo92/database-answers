	<br>Topics covered include :-
	<li>Entities
	<li>Primary Keys

<br><br>
The approach I have chosen for this Tutorial is to cover the Life span of a typical human being, from the cradle to the grave.

<br>This allows me to trace the increasing complexity in life and match it to an increasing complexity in Data Models.

	<li>The first task is to decide on the scope of our Data Model.
	<li><b>My Approach</b> has three Steps :-
	<OL><li>Establish the Scope of the Data Model
	<li>Identify the 'Things of Interest' that are within the Scope,
	These will be called <b>Entities</b>.
	<li>Determine the <b>Relationships</b> between them.
	</OL>

<br><b>DECIDING THE SCOPE OF OUR DATA MODEL</b>
<li>I have decided that the Scope is 'From the Cradle to the Grave'.
<li>This will include childhood, teenage years, becoming a student, getting a job, getting married, getting sick, and finally dying
<li>Therefore, anything outside this scope are not <b>'Things of Interest'</b>.

	<li> Primary Keys
	<li> One-to-Many Relationships
	<li> Many-to-Many Relationships



<li>Here we have added the <b>Relationships</b> between the <b>Entities</b>.

<OL><li>When this Primary Key is used in another Table, it is referred to as a'Foreign Key'.
<li>We can see a good example in this diagram, where the customer_id appears in the Customers_Payment_Methods Table as a Foreign Key.
<li>This is shown with an 'FK' symbol beside it
</OL>


<br><li><b>Mandatory Key Fields</b>
<OL><li>A Foreign Key is usually <b>mandatory</b>, in other words, a value for a customer_id in the Customers_Payment_Methods Table
must correspond to an actual value of the customer_id in the Customers_Version_1 Table.
<li>This is shown in the diagram by the short straight line at the end of the dotted line close to the Customers Table.
</OL>


<font color=red>Foreign Keys in Dezign</font>
<br>1. Foreign Keys are created automatically when you make a Relationship between two Entities.
<br>2. I recommend that you move the field up in the Entity so that it takes it place alphabetically among the Key fields.
<br>   To do this, right-click on the Entity choose the Attributes option, then click on the up or down arrow on the right-hand side.

<br><br><br>
<li>The unusual symbol in the middle of the diagram, composed of a circle with two small lines underneath it is how Inheritance is shown using the particular Data Modelling Tool that I am using,which is called Dezign.
<li>Inheritance is a very important topic when you are creating a Data Model.
<li>In plain English, we would say that Inheritance occurs where a Parent-Child relationship exists between Things of Interest (or Entities).
<li>You can ask the simple <b>'Is-a' question</b> - in this case, if we ask 'Is a Book a Product' then clearly the answer is 'Yes' so we think there is an Inheritance relationship between them.


<li>In the example of Inheritance shown in this diagram, we can see that all Products have Names and Descriptions. Therefore, Books, Food and Drink will inherit these characteristics from the parent Product.
<li>However, each type of Product will have specific characteristics that it does not share with other types of Products. For example, Books have ISBNs and Authors, but Food and Drink do not.
<li>One of the important things in your Data Model is to be sure you have identified all the Inheritance relationships.
<li>However, from many years of experince as a DBA, I should point out that relationship is often blurred in a real physical Database because it can be clumsy to implement.
<li>I sometimes find myself showing Inheritance in a Logical Data Model which then disappears when I design the Physical Database, which is what ultimately becomes the Database.

<!---
<br><br><br>
<li><b>There are three different approaches to implementing Inheritance in a Database :-</b>
<OL><li>Implement nthe design as you see it , in other words, have a separate physical Table for each Product Entity in this diagram.
<li>Add all attributes in the Product Super-Type to the Books, Food and Drink Sub-Types so you end up with three Tables. This is appealing because it seems a natural approach but it can be more difficulty when it comes to development.
<li>Add all attributes from the Books, Food and Drink Sub-Types to the Product Super-Type.
<br>This results in one large Table, where two-thirds of all Attributes are not populated in every record.
<br>However, software development can be easier, depending on the coding conventions that are followed. Currently, wasted space is not such an issue, so this Approach is common.

        <li>it has a relatively small number of values, usually less than a few dozen and never more than a few hundred.
	<li>Therefore we can show it with a Code as a Primary Key.
	<li>Data in Reference Data Tables can be used to populate drop-down lists for Users to select from.
	<li>In this way, it is used to ensure that all new data is valid.

</OL>


	<br><br><b>Customer Addresses</b>
	<li>This is a general and flexible approach to handling Addresses in our Data Model.
	<li>We have a separate Address Table, which allows us to have more than one Address for any Customer very easily.
	<li>This design also has some other benefits :-
	<OL><li>We can accomodate more than one person at the same Address.
	We need to do this because different members of a family may sign-up separately with Amazon.
	<li>With a separate table of Addresses, we can easily use commercial software to validate our Addresses.
	To find this kind of software, simply Google for "Address Validation Software".
	I have used QAS with great success in the past.
	With this approach, we can always be sure that we have 100% good Address data in our Database.
