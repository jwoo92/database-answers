When you look at the Tables for Cities, Counties, States and so on, you can see that they all have a similar structure.
<br>Therefore they can be stored in the same Table, with just a 'Level' to differentiate them.
<br>
This diagram shows an alternate version which stores all details for everything except Settlements in one Table.
<br>Settelements are different because they have Settlement Types.
