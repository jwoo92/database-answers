<!--- from <a href="mailto:nonkel@pandora.be">Nonkel Sue</a> --->
<b>User Requirements :-</b>
<!---
John had enough of being an academic continuously being on the red and the
manager of his bank on his back at all times.
Therefore, he has decided that he will quit from next year and using some money he inherited and a
loan from the bank to open <b>a Car Service Center</b>.
The way he sees it is that people own car(s) which need service.
Some people (customers) will bring their car(s) to his company for service probably annually.
He will hire some mechanics that will take care of the service by identifying the part(s) of the
car need replacing.
