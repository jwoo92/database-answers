<font size=1>
<b>BI</b> is the process of providing critical information to corporate management to help them
make better business decisions. It has become increasingly important with the growth in Web Sites,
that present a new source of information to be integrated with existing sources to enable management
to obtain a comprehensive view of how their enterprises are performing.

<P>The term <b>Business Intelligence</b> was used as early as September, 1996, when a Gartner Group report said:

<br>"By 2000, Information Democracy will emerge in forward-thinking enterprises, with Business Intelligence
information and applications available broadly to employees, consultants, customers, suppliers, and the public.
The key to thriving in a competitive marketplace is staying ahead of the competition.
Making sound business decisions based on accurate and current information takes more than intuition.
Data analysis, reporting, and query tools can help business users wade through a sea of data to synthesize
valuable information from it - today these tools collectively fall into a category called Business Intelligence."

<font size=1>In customer relationship management (CRM), <b>Customer Life Cycle</b> is a
term used to describe the progression of steps a customer goes through when considering, purchasing, using, and maintaining loyalty to a product or service.
<br>The Customer Life Cycle consists of five distinct steps:- reach, acquisition, conversion, retention,and loyalty.
<br>This means getting a potential customer's attention, teaching them what you have to offer, turning
them into a paying customer, and then keeping them as a loyal customer whose satisfaction with the product or service urges other customers to join the cycle.
<br>The customer life cycle is often depicted by an ellipse, representing the fact that customer retention
truly is a cycle and the goal of effective CRM is to get the customer to move through the cycle again and again.

<font size=1>
<b>1) A dashboard is a user interface</b>
that,somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents
information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer
dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile
dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard. However, some
product developers consciously employ this metaphor (and sometimes
the term) so that the user instantly recognizes the similarity.
<P>
<b>2) Dashboard Products</b>
Some products that aim to integrate information from multiple
components into a unified display refer to themselves as dashboards.
For example, a product might obtain information from the local
operating system in a computer, from one or more applications that
may be running, and from one or more remote sites on the Web and
present it as though it all came from the same source. Hewlett
Packard developed the first such product, which began as a tool for
customizing Windows desktops. Called Dashboard, the HP product was
subsequently acquired by Borland and then a company called Starfish.
Microsoft's Digital Dashboard tool incorporates Web-based elements
(such as news, stock quotes, and so on) and corporate elements (such
as e-mail, applications, and so on) into Outlook. Dashboards may be
customized in a multitude of ways and named accordingly, generally,
for example as a general corporate or enterprise dashboard, or more
specifically, as a CIO or CEO dashboard.
<b>Microsoft</b> offer an 'Interative Digital Dashboard'.

A Relational Database is a logical way of looking at data and provides a level of abstraction on top of the physical files where the data is actually stored on a computer.
So you can say things like 'Find me all my Customers' (SELECT * FROM customers in SQL) without worrying how and where the Customers data is stored.

<font size=1>In general terms, an ENTITY is a 'Thing'.
For example, a Car, a Person, and a Building.
For a Data Model, with a defined scope, then an entity is a 'Thing of Interest' in the scope.
Data Modeling is the first step in the creation of a database.
In a database, an Entity becomes a Table, and this is why an Entity is very important.
For example, if you were creating a Data Model for vehicle rental, then a vehicle would
certainly be on of your 'Things of Interest', along with Customers,Rental Bookings, and so on.

Entities have Relationships to other entities, which are defined in Entity-Relationship Diagrams,
called ERDs.

<td bgcolor="lightyellow" valign=top><b><font color=blue size=2>Normalization</b></td>
<td bgcolor="lightyellow" valign=TOP>
<font size=1>This definition is taken from  <a href="http://www.whatis.com" target="_new">WhatIs.com</a>.
<br>
In creating a database, normalization is the process of organizing it into tables in
such a way that the results of using the database are always unambiguous and as intended.
Normalization may have the effect of duplicating data within the database and often results
in the creation of additional tables.
While normalization tends to increase the duplication of data, it does not introduce redundancy, which is unnecessary duplication.
Normalization is typically a refinement process after the initial exercise of identifying the
data objects that should be in the database, identifying their relationships, and
defining the tables required and the columns within each table.
<P><a href="normal_forms.html">Ted Codd</a> defined degrees of <b>Normalization</b> of relational database tables and include:

<P><b>First normal form (1NF).</b>
<br>This is the "basic" level of normalization and generally corresponds to the
definition of any database, namely:
<br>It contains two-dimensional tables with rows and columns.
Each column corresponds to a sub-object or an attribute of the object represented by the entire table.
Each row represents a unique instance of that sub-object or attribute and must be different in some way from any other row (that is, no duplicate rows are possible).
All entries in any column must be of the same kind. For example, in the column labeled "Customer," only customer names or numbers are permitted.

<P><b>Second normal form (2NF).</b>
<br>At this level of normalization, each column in a table that is not a determiner of the contents of another column must itself be a function of the other columns in the table.
For example, in a table with three columns containing customer ID, product sold, and price of the product when sold,
the price would be a function of the customer ID (entitled to a discount) and the specific product.

<P><b>Third normal form (3NF).</b>
<br>At the second normal form, modifications are still possible because a change to one row in a table may affect data that refers to this information from another table.
For example, using the customer table just cited, removing a row describing a customer purchase (because of a return perhaps) will also remove the fact that the product has a certain price.
In the third normal form, these tables would be divided into two tables so that product pricing would be tracked separately.

<P><b>Domain/key normal form (DKNF).</b>
<br>A key uniquely identifies each row in a table.
A domain is the set of permissible values for an attribute.
By enforcing key and domain restrictions, the database is assured of being freed from modification anomalies.
DKNF is the normalization level that most designers aim to achieve.

'SQL for Smarties'</a> in the Section on Normalization ...
<br>"A Predicate is a statement of the form A(X), which means that X has the property A.
For example, "John is from Indiana" is a predicate statement; here, "John" is the subject and "is from Indiana" is the predicate.
A relation is a predicate with two or more subjects.
"John and Bob are brothers" is an example of a relation. The common way of visualizing a set of relational statements is
as a table where the columns are attributes of the relation and each row is a specific relational statement.
<br>When Dr.Codd defined the relational model, he gave
<a href="codds_rules.html">12 rules</a> for the vizualisation of the relation as a table."
<P>That's the end of the quote from Joe's book.

A <b>UUID</b> (<b>U</b>niversal <b>U</b>nique <b>I</b>dentifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify some object or entity on the Internet.
Depending on the specific mechanisms used, a UUID is either guaranteed to be different or is, at least, extremely likely to
be different from any other UUID generated until 3400 A.D.
The UUID relies upon a combination of components to ensure uniqueness.

A guaranteed UUID contains a reference to the network address of the host that generated the UUID, a timestamp
(a record of the precise time of a transaction), and a randomly generated component. Because the network address identifies
a unique computer, and the timestamp is unique for each UUID generated from a particular host, those two components should
sufficiently ensure uniqueness.

However, the randomly generated element of the UUID is added as a protection against any unforseeable problem.

A UUID is specified as part of the tModel data structure, which represents a service type (a generic representation of a
registered service) in the UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) registry.

This mechanism is used to discover Web services.

UUIDs could be generated to refer to almost anything imaginable. Microsoft and some other software companies refer to GUIDs
(global unique identifiers), a type of UUID used to refer to Component Object Module objects and other software components.

The first UUIDs were created in the Network Computing System (NCS), and subsequently became a component of the Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE) of the Open Software Foundation (OSF).

<td bgcolor="lightyellow" valign=TOP><pre><font face=Verdana size=1>Unicode is the 'Universal Code'.  It takes two bytes for each Character.  This description is copied from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnxml/html/understxml.asp" target="_new">Microsoft Page on XML</a>.

<a href="http://www.unicode.org/" target="_new">The Unicode Consortium</a> decided it would be a good idea to define one universal code page (using 2 bytes instead of one per character) that
covers all the languages of the world so that this mapping problem between different code pages would be gone forever.

So if Unicode solves cross-platform character encoding issues, why hasn't it become the only standard?
The first problem is that switching to Unicode sometimes means doubling the size of all your files-which in a network-bound world is not ideal.
Some people therefore still prefer to use the older, single-byte character sets such as ISO-8859-1 to ISO-8859-15, Shift-JIS, EUC-KR, and so forth.

The second problem is that there are still many systems out there that are not Unicode-based at all, which means that on a network, some of the
byte values that make up the Unicode characters can cause major problems for those older systems.

So Unicode Transformation Formats (UTF) have been defined; they use bit-shifting techniques to encode Unicode characters as byte values that will be
"transparent" (or flow through safely) on those older systems.

The most popular of these character encodings is UTF-8. UTF-8 takes the first 127 characters of the Unicode standard (which happen to be the basic
Latin characters, A-Z, a-z, and 0-9, and a few punctuation characters) and maps those directly to single byte values.
It then applies a bit-shifting technique using the high bit of the bytes to encode the rest of the Unicode characters.
The result of all this is that the little Swedish character � (0xE5) becomes the following 2-byte gibberish å (0xC3 0xA5).
So unless you can do bit shifting in your head, data encoded in UTF-8 is not human readable.

This makes XML potentially tremendously powerful. Unfortunately, the power has not been fully exploited,
partly because of a lack of agreement on standards and common definitions about things like Customers.
There are a number of competing standards, in areas such as Business and Finance, and this contributes
to the lack of progress.

Summary: Showcases the XML functionality of SQL Server 2000 by turning SQL Server into an object repository
using XML as the bridge between relational and object-oriented data. (23 printed pages)


Introduction
In the world of XML enterprise development, nothing is certain but death, taxes, and having to work with a
relational back-end data store.
And just like death and taxes, it can be a very painful endeavor.

The problem is translating between the hierarchical, semi-structured XML data model and the normalized relational data model.
The former is well suited for data exchange and modeling business data, the latter for persistence storage.
One can only speculate that if Ben Franklin were alive today he would be developing loosely-coupled architectures that leveraged
the extensible nature of the XML data model�and loathing the one certainty in enterprise development, having to integrate with
the antiquated relational database (in addition to life's other "certainties"�death and taxes).

However, there is a solution�SQLXML.

SQLXML 3.0 is add-on product for SQL Server 2000 that enhances SQL Server 2000 XML support.
It enables the developers to bridge the gap between XML and relational databases by providing a number of features that
translate between the two data models.

Note   This column is based on the SQL Server XML functionality that is available in SQLXML 3.0.
Since SQL Server 2000 was released in fall 2000, the WebData group at Microsoft has provided three fully supported upgrades to
enhance and improve the XML features.
These frequent releases are a result of customer demand and the fast-changing world of XML standards.

In general, the SQLXML feature set can be divided into two major areas:

Server side functionality which can be accessed using Transact-SQL extensions
Client side/ Middle tier functionality accessible through ADO, HTTP, or .NET data provider.
This article will concentrate on the server side functionality, and show how to leverage that functionality to turn SQL Server
into an object repository.




An Employee class that contains an employee ID, first and last name, and title for the employee�fairly standard stuff.
In addition, each employee contains zero to many address objects (stored in the Employee's _addressList ArrayList) with
all the standard address information.
Again, fairly simple stuff but don't worry, the customer is asking for a lot in version 2, so the project will be
extending the business logic object model soon enough.

Following standard database design, the following relational tables have been designed for persistence storage of the
business objects:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employee] (
   [EmployeeID] [int] NOT NULL ,
   [LastName] [nvarchar] (50) NULL ,
   [FirstName] [nvarchar] (50) NULL ,
   [Title] [nvarchar] (50) NULL ,
   [Overflow] [ntext] NULL
) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Address] (
   [EmployeeID] [int] NOT NULL ,
   [AddressType] [nvarchar] (10) NOT NULL ,
   [Street] [nvarchar] (200) NULL ,
   [City] [nvarchar] (100) NULL ,
   [State] [nvarchar] (2) NULL ,
   [Zip] [nvarchar] (20) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO



In part two of this article, the server-side will be replaced with client-side features that provide equivalent functionality.
Both articles will also discuss the merits and pitfalls of each solution and how the functionality can be leveraged to solve real world use cases.





<b>Conclusion</b>
As with any design, there are definitely some tradeoffs.
XML as a transport is clearly not the most performant mechanism for database access.
There is a lot of markup that is being transported over the wire.
But as shown, by using XML as the transport to and from the database and OpenXML as the persistence mechanism,
one can significantly decouple the database layer from the business logic layer and thereby develop a very
flexible and extensible design. In general, it comes down to the particular requirements of a given application.

It is possible to move the XML shredding/ generation code off the database server by doing this client side with
the SQLXML mapping technologies. Part 2 of this article will examine those technologies and will refactor the
object repository to use those technologies.

<td width="60%" valign="TOP">
<font color=blue size=1>
Client/server describes the relationship between two computer programs in which one program, the client, makes a service request from another program, the server, which fulfills the request. Although the client/server idea can be used by programs within a single computer, it is a more important idea in a network. In a network, the client/server model provides a convenient way to interconnect programs that are distributed efficiently across different locations. Computer transactions using the client/server model are very common. For example, to check your bank account from your computer, a client program in your computer forwards your request to a server program at the bank. That program may in turn forward the request to its own client program that sends a request to a database server at another bank computer to retrieve your account balance. The balance is returned back to the bank data client, which in turn serves it back to the client in your personal computer, which displays the information for you.
The client/server model has become one of the central ideas of network computing. Most business applications being written today use the client/server model. So does the Internet's main program, TCP/IP. In marketing, the term has been used to distinguish distributed computing by smaller dispersed computers from the "monolithic" centralized computing of mainframe computers. But this distinction has largely disappeared as mainframes and their applications have also turned to the client/server model and become part of network computing.

In the usual client/server model, one server, sometimes called a daemon, is activated and awaits client requests. Typically, multiple client programs share the services of a common server program. Both client programs and server programs are often part of a larger program or application. Relative to the Internet, your Web browser is a client program that requests services (the sending of Web pages or files) from a Web server (which technically is called a Hypertext Transport Protocol or Hypertext Transfer Protocol server) in another computer somewhere on the Internet. Similarly, your computer with TCP/IP installed allows you to make client requests for files from File Transfer Protocol (File Transfer Protocol) servers in other computers on the Internet.

Other program relationship models included master/slave, with one program being in charge of all other programs, and peer-to-peer, with either of two programs able to initiate a transaction.
