<b>Summary</b>
<li>Here we are, back where we started.
<li>We are looking at an overview Schema, which shows only the names of the Tables and the relationships.
<li>It's very useful when you want to discuss the Schema with the users, developers or managers.

<li>It shows that Products have Suppliers, and can be ordered by Customers and delivered to Addresses.

<br><br>
<li>In this Tutorial, we have looked at the design of a typical Database Schema.
<li>I hope that next time you look at a Schema you should be comfortable understanding it and using it.

<br><br>
<li>I hope I have been able to explain some of the theory behind this Database Schema.
<li>In particular, I hope that you will be more comfortable the next time you see one.
