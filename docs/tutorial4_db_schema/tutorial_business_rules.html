<pre><font color=blue face="Verdana" size=2><b>Business Rules</b>
Let me close by discussing the important topic of Business Rules which must underly any Schema you look at.
These are often implemented as 'Constraints' in the Database.

<br>These Business Rules are important because they define the conditions that the Database must meet.
<li>For example, every Order must be associated with a valid Product.
<li>This prevents invalid Orders being entered into the Database.

<li>These Rules can be understood by both the Users and the Database designer.
<li>When you extend a Database Schema, it is always valuable to keep these Rules up-to-date.
<li>This is not always done meticulously but is necessary where Users will 'sign-off' on their requirements.
