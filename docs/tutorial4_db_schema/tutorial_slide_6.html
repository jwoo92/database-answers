<hr><b>Payments</b>
<li>Of course, we have to pay for what we have ordered before we get to consume it.
<li>Fortunately, paying in Starbucks is quite straightforward.
<li>In passing, let's note that the total price we have to pay is derived from the total cost of the individual items.

<br><br><b>Customer Payment Methods</b>
<li>These will usually be Cash or Credit Card, and are shown in more detail in the next diagram.
<li>Payments are simpler at Starbucks than Amazon.com, but our design is general and covers both.

<br><br>
<b>Derived Data</b>
<li>The total price we have to pay is derived from the total cost of the individual items.
<li>In a 'Normalised' Database Schema, we do not normally show derived fields, such as total figures.
<li>This allows us to drill-down to the basic fundamental data.
<li>We want to get to the point where we can't remove anything without losing meaning or value.
<li>For this reason, I have shown the total price as a 'Derived' field, and called it 'der_order_price'.
<li>One of the strengths of the Relational Database is that it strips away everything which is not fundamental.


<br><br>
<b>Reference Data</b>
<li>Reference data is important, because it occurs in virtually every Database Schema in the real world.

<br><br><b>Status</b>
<li>The status of an order in Starbucks usually changes so quickly that we don't need to keep track of it.
<li>It is shown here to anticipate its use for Amazon.com, which is more complex, as we will see later.
<li>The Status can be part of the Customer_Orders table, and take values from the 'Ref_Order_Status_Codes' table.
