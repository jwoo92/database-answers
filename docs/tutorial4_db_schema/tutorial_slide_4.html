<b>Our motto - Keep It Simple and Straightforward (KISS)</b>
<br>We are starting in a simple way with this diagram which shows two Entities without a Relationship.
<br>The Relationship between them is established in the next diagram, when the meaning of the 'PK' and 'FK' will be explained.
<br><br>
<b>Products</b>
<br>I want  to convey to you the value of seeing the real world as a Database Schema.
<br>It's always very interesting and adds a challenge as you walk or drive around and
<br>think about how you would create a Database Schema for the real world that you can see around you.
<br>
<li>Let's say we go into Starbucks to get a coffee and something to eat.
<li>At this point, Starbucks doesn't know us as a Customer.
<li>Also we might be doing the office coffee run, amd maybe we have with us our Order on a piece of paper.
<li>These two 'Things of Interest', Products and Customer_Orders, are not related until we give our Order.
<li>Data Modellers commonly describe a Database Schema as an Entity-Relationship-Diagram, or ERD.
<li>The word 'Relationship' is therefore very important.
<li>However, at this point, we haven't established a Relationship between the Products and the Customer_Orders.
<li>We will do that in the next slide.
