<hr><b>Products</b>
<br>Let's move on to the topic of Products. As you might imagine, this can be a complex area.
<br>Two important aspects are Inheritance and Product Hierarchies.
<br><br><b>Inheritance</b>
<li>This diagram shows a 'Products' table that holds details that are common to all Products.
<li>It shows an 'Amazon_Books' table that holds details that are specific to Books from Amazon.
<li>It also shows a 'Starbucks_Products' table that holds details that are specific to Products from Starbucks.
<li>These two are Children of the Parent 'Products' Table.
<li>Therefore, this concept is referred to as Inheritance and is very powerful in the real world.
<li>On the diagram, it is shown  by the circle with two short horizontal lines underneath it.
<li>Data Modellers define these as 'Sub-Types' of a 'Super-Type'.
<li>This diagram shows the Logical level of the Schema.
<li>At the physical level, this can be implemented in one of three ways :-
<OL>
<li>Three tables - exactly like the Logical level.
<li>Two tables - one for Amazon and one for Starbucks, with the common data items copied down from the Parent Table.
<li>One table - at the higher level, with common data items and those for Amazon and Starbucks all in one large table.
</OL>

<b>Recursive Product Hierarchy</b>
<li>The line that comes out of the Ref_Product_Types Table and then goes back in again is informally called a 'Rabbits Ear',
<br>or more formally a 'Recursive Relationship'.  It defines a Product Hierarchy.
<li>It means that any Product can be part of a higher grouping of Products, such as Categories, Types and so on.
<li>This is a very neat and powerful way to implement this concept.
<li>In our example, the 'parent_product_type_code' is a reference to the next highest level in the hierarchy.

<br><br><b>Suppliers</b>
<li>I introduce Suppliers at this point because Starbucks and Amazon.com are both Suppliers of Products within our Schema.
<li>This would be the starting-point for Schema involving a more detailed analysis of Suppliers.
