<br>[Dimple] : I'd like to visit Windsor Castle, because it's one of the most popular tourist attractions in England, and it's easy to get to from London.

[Dimple] Wow, Toby, there are so many Banks, Cafes, Pubs, Restaurants, Shops, Wine Bars and Hospitals !!!
<br>[Toby] : Yes, let's start thinking about our Data Model.
<br>The other thing that we see when we look around is people - lots of people.

<b>5) STARTING OUR DATA MODEL :</b>
<br><img alt="People and Establishments" src="images/ip_people_and_establishments.gif">
<br><br>[Dimple] : How do we get started ?
<br>[Toby] : Well, we know that we have People and Places.
<br> The simplest start is to call all these places Establishments.
<br>Then we simply have different kinds of Establishments.
<br> And we have people - local people, visitors, people working here, people here on business and so on.
<br><br> [Dimple] : Hmmm - so how do we translate what we know to help us get started with our Data Model !!!

<br><br>[Dimple] : Toby, I am one of these People so how I am I going to identify myself from everybody else.
<br>[Toby] : We will give everybody a Unique Identifier and every Establishment its own unique Identifier.
<br>When we use these we call them <b>Primary Keys</b>, and show them in the diagram with a <b>PK</b> on the left-hand side.
<br>[Dimple] : That sounds good, Toby, but I don't know what it means.

<br>
<img alt="People Establishments and Visits" WIiiiDTH=460 src="images/ip_people_establishments_and_visits.gif">
<br>[Toby] : Dimple, now we can add some interesting details because we know that one person can visit many Establishments.
<br>We also know that one Establishment is visited by many Visitors.
<br>Then we call this a <b>Many-to-Many Relationship</b> between People and Establishments.
<!---
<br><br>To make it easier for you to understand I have expanded the <b>Many-to-Many Relationship</b> into two different things, which are called <b>One-to-Many Relationships</b>.
<br>[Dimple] : So Toby, is that like saying that One Person can make Many Visits to many Establishments ?
<br>[Toby] : Yes, Dimple - that's great - and we can also say that One Establishments can have Visits from many People.
<br>At this point, we can show how all these boxes are related, and that is a very big step, because it takes us to the idea of 'Relationships'.
<br>And now we can see how useful our Identifiers can be because we can include the Person and Establishment Identifiers in our Visits table. Then the Person_ID field becomes a link to a record for a Person in the Person Table.
<br>This link is what is called a <b>Foreign Key</b> and we can see it's shown with <b>'FK'</b> on the left-hand side.

<br>[Dimple] : Toby, when we go into a shop we want to buy something.
<br>And there are thousands and thousands of possibilities.
<br>How do we deal with all that in our little Data Model ?
<br>[Toby] : Well Dimple, it's really quite easy. It's like all our Modelling where we look for simple patterns that cover many situations.
<br>[Dimple] : Hmm - I don't know what that means. Maybe if you showed me I might understand it.
<br>[Toby] : OK.
<!---
<br>Everything that we buy is called a Product, and all we have to do is simply define the type of each Product - such as a Coffee, Muffin or a Newspaper.
<br>Then we draw a little box called Products and say that every Product has a Type.
<br>In other words, there is a Relationship between the Products and Product_Types boxes.
<br>The lines are called Relationships and they are very important in Data Modelling.
<br>We are now creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram or "ERD".

<br>[Dimple] : OK, Toby. I hope I don't have to think too much because I might get a headache ?
<br>[Toby] : No, Dimple, I will do the thinking and talking and all you have to do is nod your head when you understand.
<br>[Dimple] : OK, Toby. I promise to do that.

<br><b>15b) PEOPLE AND STAFF:</b>
<br>[Toby] : We already said that we have Local People and Tourists.
<br>Some of these Local People are shoppers and some of them will be working in the shops.
<br>We will call the workers 'Staff' and we know more about them than we do about the Visitors.
<br>For example, we will probably know the Gender of everybody just by looking at them.

<br><b>15c) PEOPLE AND STAFF:</b>
<br>For Staff, we will usually also know their Data of Birth and their Home Address.
<br>Therefore, although they are all People, we know more about Staff than we do about Visitors.
<br>In Data Modelling we have a very powerful approach that we call <b>Inheritance</b> that we can use here.
<br>It's shown by the funny circle with two lines.
<br>If we want to describe this in English, we would say that Staff inherit the People_Type_Code and Gender from the parent Entity of People, and in addition, they have a Date of Birth and Home Address.
--->

<b>24) PEOPLE AND STAFF:</b>
<br>Does that make sense, Dimple ?
<br>[Dimple] : I think so, Toby.
<br>Is it like saying that we inherit having two arms and two legs from our Parents because they have two arms and two legs, but that we have also have things that are just us ?
<br>[Toby] : Yes, Dimple - that's great - let's take a break and do some shopping !!!
<br>[Dimple] : I like the sound of that, Toby. Can I have an icecream now?

<br><br>
<img alt="Staff,Establishments and Derived Fields" src="images/ip_staff_establishments_and_derived_fields_model.gif">

<br>[Dimple] : Toby, how do we specify that Staff work in Establishments ?
<br>[Toby] : Dimple, that's a very good question.
<br>Fortunately, the answer is very easy, and we simply add a <b>One-to-Many Relationship</b> between the Staff and the Establishment.
<!---
<br><b>16b11) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</b>
<br> In English, we would say that a <b>One-to-Many Relationship</b> means every member of Staff must work in one Establishemnt and every Establishment can employ many members of Staff.
<br>In the diagram, we show this with a <b>Foreign Key</b> by the establishment_id field in the Staff Entity.
<br>So if we look closely at the Staff Entity, we will see <b>'FK'</b> by the establishment_id field.
<br>[Dimple] : OK, that sounds good, and I can see how the Identifiers are very important.
<br>[Toby] : I am glad to hear it, Dimple.
<br><b>16c111) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</b>
<br>There is one more thing I have to say.
<br>We are learning Data Modelling and one important thing about Data Modelling is that it has to follow a set of Rules.
<br>These Rules help us to produce good Data Models and so they they are very important.
<br><b>16d) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</b>
<br>One of the Rules is that we cannot include any bits of data that can be derived from any other bits of data.
<br>For example, we usually want to know how many people work in a Shop or Cafe.
<br>Therefore we include a <b>Staff Count</b> field with the Establishment.

<br><b>16e) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</b>
When it comes to finding the derived value that goes in here, we will count the records in the Staff Table for each Establishment.
<br>Therefore, it's a <b>derived Field</b> and we call it a name that starts with 'derived_' to make things clear.
<br> Does that sound sensible, Dimple ?
<br>[Dimple] : I suppose so, Toby.
<br>But I've got a headache, can we go for an icecream now ?
